This website was created using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io),
a static website generator which  processes Markdown text into HTML, avoiding
the complexities of hypertext.

Hugo requires a "theme," and I chose [DocDock](https://docdock.vjeantet.fr).
DocDock is usually used for software documentation, but I found it very 
effective for organizing scanned letters and photos.

The final build is done on [Fleek](https://fleek.co). I have been editing the Markdown text files using the venerable (ca. 1999) Linux terminal editor, [nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano).
