Mefloquine, an anti-malarial drug, has been pulled from the US market since 2009.  Unfortunately for me, my consulting gig[^1] in India was sometime in the 1990's.

The physician I saw as a prerequisite to my India trip was convinced, due to my **"interesting"** medical history, that I **really** needed to take a prophylaxis against malaria.  

A moment's research on either his or my part would have shown that the area of India in which I was to consult was dry (very dry) and malaria was by far the least risky aspect of going there. 

Unfortunately, he prescribed a good hefty dose of mefloquine for before, during and after the trip.

I was supposed to look to the startup of the fiber recovery portion of the plant.  The owner faced a hard deadline (some tax-related issue) and scheduled the trip accordingly.  In addition to me, another "FG Paper" consultant was there to look after the papermachione[^2].

The mill was nowhere near ready to start up.

[^1]: Consulting as an employee of yet another paper company "FG Paper", which is now extinct.  At the time, they licenced their paper deinking process and expertise.  I was the Research director just then, and in the hot seat when the "FG Process" was licensed to a company in India.

[^2]:  The papermachine was one which had run for years in the US.  My colleague was very familiar with the machine, and felt like he was visiting and old (if mechanical) friend.  He was also not dosed up with mefloquine.
