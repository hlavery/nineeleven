The following letters, mostly from Grandma Gladys Potter to her daughter Mary, are the continuation of an earlier project of mine that aims to preserve some family letters and documents. 

For various reasons, the original websites may not be stable long-term.

The original site, [hlavery.org](http://hlavery.org), is a Wordpress blog hosted by GoDaddy, which frequently updates Wordpress and its themes, and these revisions will surely eventually crash the site. Also, GoDaddy has a strong preference for getting paid, and my deposit may run out,

So, first, we have a static version (HTML pages only, with no Wordpress magic) of Mom's saved letters, [Gladys Potter's Family](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPJjQ6w4BUY3Ly6efkp76jvGqjx5keMN7SRzGuPFMgHrR)

Then, a static version of my Dad's World War II letters, originally hlavery.xyz...which is itself already a static site, but this will serve as a backup.

[WWII Letters of Hugh H Lavery](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmc26qoy4qe2xT4PNTxnR8EyXEfaK3XQWEXRo4nC5C1GM7)

Finally, for now, a series of letters which Gabrielle (Heffron) Lavery wrote to her son Hugh, my father, while he was away at college for his first year.
